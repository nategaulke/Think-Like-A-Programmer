# Think Like A Programmer Solutions

As a summer project in between sophomore and junior semesters, I went through the exercises in V. Anton Spraul's *Think Like a Programmer*. I had already begun reading it as part of my involvement in the book club for University of Central Florida's branch of [ACM/ACM-W](https://ucfacmw.org/) (Association for Computer Machinery/Women in Tech). I wanted to continue reading through it while also applying what I was learning. These solutions are public for anyone who would like to compare solutions for exercises in the book or if they are stuck on a difficult question. Some of the topics were the same algorithms and data structures I had learned in Computer Science I, I still enjoyed rereading through these topics.

Some useful knowledge while going through the book & exercises:
* C++ programming language
* Problem Solving Strategies
* "Master Plan" for approaching open-ended coding projects with multiple parts
* Effective Code Reuse
* Review of sorting algorithms, dynamic memory allocation, object-oriented programming, linked lists, stacks, recursion, etc.

While the exercises are not mine, the solutions were made by me, using the book's resources and the internet when learning a new component. All solutions were checked for memory leaks/other errors using valgrind. The exercises in Chapter 1 are not included in the repository because those exercises were not coding questions. The exercises in Chapter 8 are excluded because they were beyond the scope of what I wanted to accomplish for the project since each was its own mini project. However, I did read both chapters and found them to be rich with information.

## How to Run
(Note: Assumes the GCC Compiler is already downloaded to computer)

1. Clone this repository to your computer
2. Go to the directory of the exercise you would like to run
3. Enter `g++ Exercise[CHAPTER]-[PROBLEM NUMBER].cpp`
4. Run `./a.out`
